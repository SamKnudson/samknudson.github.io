    <p> 3 Doors Down is a rock band, that was founded in Escatawpa, Mississippi in 1996. The band initially started with 3 members: Brad Arnold (lead vocals and drums), Matt Roberts (lead guitar and backing vocals), and Todd Harrell (bass). The band came up with its name when they saw a sign missing letters reading "Doors Down" while walking through the town of Foley, Alabama. As a trio the band added 3 to "Doors Down" and came up with their band name "3 Doors Down". That is a summary of the formation of the band. </p>
    <p>3 Doors Down went from a three person band to a five person band over the years. The only original member remaining is lead vocalist Brad Arnold. Matt Roberts left the band for health reasons in 2012. Todd Harrell left due to being arrested for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, possession of a controlled substance and domestic violence simple assault. Todd is still in prison for around 8 more years as of 2020.</p>
    <p>The current band is made up of: Brad Arnold (lead vocals), Chris Henderson (rhythm guitar and backing vocals), Greg Upchurch (drums), Chet Roberts (lead guitar and backing vocals), and Justin Biltonen (bass). Chris took over rhythm guitar from Matt Roberts in 1998. The drummer is the role in the band to have been changed the most. Greg took over drums from Daniel Adair (drums and backing vocals 2002-2005). Daniel took drums over from Richard Liles (drums 2000-2002). Finally, Richard took drums over from Brad (drums 1996-2000). Chet took over lead guitar and backing vocals from Matt in 2012. Justin took bass over from Todd in 2013. </p>
